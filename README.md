# Simple Vue2 Project, With Vuetify, Echarts, and Google Maps.

This is a simple sample project that I developed for a job interview. It loads user and user posts data from an API with axion then tabulate a Vuetify table. When the user clicks on a row of the table it then drop a marker into the map shoeing the user's location with Google Maps. Also, shows their post counts and it's overall percentage in a piechart with echarts.

The modules I used are;
* npm install echarts vue-echarts
* npm install vue2-google-maps@0.10.7
* npm install vuetify
* npm install axios vue-axios

## Project setup
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
